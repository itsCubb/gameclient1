# so I want to make sure the icons in the top right; (LoginIcon, FriendsIcon, NotificationsIcon, ShoppingCartIcon) all have a dropdown and they all work for in case I want to add something later in the future and make sure that when I click on them it shows the dropdown.

# Help me fix my layout because right now its broken and everytime I try to add something new or a new feature the whole thing just let me click on them or implement the new feature probably cuz of my CSS (THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT THOUGH, I NEED HELP WITH MY CSS IN GENERAL)

# Also want to make sure that when i hover over the carousel on the right that it stops moving and shows me the option im currently hovering over, otherwise refresh scrolling smoothly

# And if i do click on one of the options in the carousel it updates my big box with that option so lets say i clikc on the Prop Hunt option it makes that option appear on the big box in the middle
